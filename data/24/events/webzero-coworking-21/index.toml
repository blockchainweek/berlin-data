Kick-off Berlin Blockchain Week in true Berlin style by working from a traditional crypto Spätkauf.

The Blockspati officially opens its doors for day one. 

Come co-work, enjoy a crypto-branded mate, try out a quest and network with builders, founders and creators in the space.

We'll have snacks, beverages and a Starlink router to keep your WiFi at super strength all day long.
