​Innovation doesn't just happen. It takes an institutional mindset that facilitates new business creation, IP ownership, and talent acquisition. Berlin, with its thriving blockchain ecosystem, is doing something right. The question is: what can we teach teach the rest of the world? In this panel, we bring three of Berlin's biggest institutions (IHK, Berlin Senate, and Berlin Partner) together to discuss what role institutions play in building the future of the decentralized web - a mission that is famously anti-institution?
