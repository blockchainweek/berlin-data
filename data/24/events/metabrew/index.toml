This is a Meetup and pop-up store for Metabrew - the web3 beer as part of the Berlin Blockchain Week. We welcome everyone there is no need to be part of the Metabrew community already.

​MetaBrewSociety is the leading Web3 beer brand and community. Created by a group of friends and entrepreneurs who love crypto, tech, beer, delicious food and festivals.

​No agenda just a casual hangout at a bar drinking beer, talking about crypto, NFTs and realworld applications.

​(This is not a official Metabrew event nor sponsored by it.)

​There will be Metabrew for sell, only hard money accepted (cash, Bitcoin lightning and for easiness Matic).

​

​Looking forward to see many of you there.
