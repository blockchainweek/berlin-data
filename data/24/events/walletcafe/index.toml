​Join us for the vibes! 🌐💸

TL;DR

If like me you’re attending both DAPPCon and ETH Berlin, I invite you to join me for an afternoon of networking and brainstorming ideas about the future of the wallet space.

On 22nd of May at 5PM, we’re meeting at Eiswerk Berlin conveniently located in the centre of Berlin.

Come and refill your batteries before the rest of the Blockchain week. We will be serving good coffee, followed by food and good music.

Join us if you are looking to:

 ⁃ meet fellow wallet builders
 ⁃ learn from the big players in the wallet space
 ⁃ meet the disruptors of the wallet space
 ⁃ get hired or hire more people
 ⁃ learn how to build a hard wallet (from yours truly)
 ⁃ make new friends and find cool people to build with
 ⁃ (And most importantly) re-charge under good vibes only

Stay caffeinated, stay innovative.
